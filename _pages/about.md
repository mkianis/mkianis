Hello! Welcome to my website! I am a geoscientist passionate about the Earth dynamics. I develop and implement mathematical tools to investigate geodetic and geophysical problems. Topics of interest include machine learning, Earth rotation variations, Earth system modelling (climate, atmosphere, ocean, mantle and core), and geophysical fluid dynamics. [I am currently a PhD student at ETH Zürich](https://space.igp.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.Mjc5NDM0.TGlzdC8zNzY0LC0xNTYwNTYzOTU1.html). 

You can look at the full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qCI0O08AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa-Kiani-Shahvandi) profiles.

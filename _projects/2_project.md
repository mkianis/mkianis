In this project, we provide the predictions of Effective Angular Momentum Functions of the Earth (EAM) with a forecasting horizon of two weeks. The predicted EAM include

1. Atmospheric Angular Momentum (AAM)
2. Oceanic Angular Momentum (OAM)
3. Hydrological Angular Momentum (HAM)
4. Sea-Level Angular Momentum (SLAM)

The methodologies, descriptions, and predictions are provided operationally on [ETH ZÃ¼rich Geodetic Prediction Center](https://gpc.ethz.ch/EAM/).
